Lee's Feedback

Hi Team,

Great work on this project. I like the way the code is laid out. The syntax is clean, well written, and easy to read. The pages are consistent throughout. I also love the JavaScript implementation. I would recommend all images being in the images folder which will make your folder layout much cleaner. This is a great project! It was a pleasure having you in class this semester and keep up the good work!!

Thank you,

Lee
