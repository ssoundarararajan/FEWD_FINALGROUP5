        <h2>A brief history of FOSS and Linux</h2>
        
        
        <p>
                 A brief history of FOSS and Linux as well as resources related, along with my history.
              My interest with Linux, and even computers was pretty early. Very first Windows was with Windows 3.1, then Windows 95 and Windows 98. These were my high school computers with the occasional Windows 3.11 that was still in the wild on the Network. I have been using MS Windows starting with these three OSes, at home as well as in School. They were everywhere, nothing else except for a few Macintosh computers in the art classes. I finished High School in 1999, and had heard about Linux, but never had any chance to actually use it. After graduation, I got a new CD-RW and finally was able to download a .ISO file for Red Hat 5.2. I booted the new disk, and for the first time saw a live image of Linux. There was no internet, I did not have a book and almost no instructions except forum pages of other people talking about it. The installation was all manual, had to pick options that were very new to me. Such as choosing between two desktop environments, KDE and GNOME. Right there, having a real choice, something Windows never would allow sold me. Though with no internet setup, and very little applications, as well as having zero idea how to use the terminal, and install new programs I didnt use it that much, except to explore. A few weeks later Windows 98 went back on. I would go on a couple years later for the first edition of Fedora Core Linux, (part of Red Hat) then the very first Ubuntu Linux “Warty Warthog” version 4.10.  I would have stuck with Ubuntu and Windows for many years, leaving and coming back to Linux many times. Enter Windows XP in 2001, and dual booting. Though the stopping point was always the same story. I was in need of Wi-Fi to get internet, but Linux didnt have any drivers from your typical Logitech/ Netgear USB dongles. They had zero software support.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward to 2011. It had been several years since my last use of Ubuntu, or any other Linux and something reminded me to check in with it. Ubuntu had a new desktop environments and had increased its hardware drivers a ton. I built a small mini ITX PC and ran Ubuntu on it and it worked perfectly. Internet, my graphics card, everything. This was when Windows 7 was still king of the desktop, but this new small PC because a great secondary one. Finally a fully working computer running Linux that I can do everything on. Then the next huge win. Valve the creators of Steam games with the failure of Windows 8/ 8.1 announced they would be support in house development of native Linux software. They made their Steam client work then ported what games they had made. Then they worked on the Proton emulation compatibility tool that made Windows only games work great in Linux.  Valve also had many partnerships with hardware vendors such as AMD and NVIDA for Linux device driver support. (AMD being baked right into the Kernel) Other software programs such as Googles Chrome browser became very good on Linux also. With its sync option, you can save and move OSes and not loose your browser settings and book marks. Tons of hours have been saved with all these improvements, along with of course the improved cloud storage and backups. Moving to Linux has never been easier.

                <p>
                    Speaking of moving to Linux, recent years YouTube has had a ton of Linux specific channels pop up, some are beginner friendly such as “Switched To Linux”, where Tom has videos showing things like making a bootable USB drive, and introduction to the Terminal, as well as other more advanced channels, up to including full System Admin instruction videos, all for free. Amazon has books you can buy for any level as well. Best way I have found out is to install a virtual machine and download a ISO file of any distribution you want to learn and install it there. Most people just use Virtualbox for this. You can find Linux everywhere, but hidden behind a product name. For example Android OS on mobile is a version of Linux, most HDTVs, routers, GPS and in car infotainment systems are run by it, as well as a lot of commercial software, including Apples I Phone/ Pad, and yes even MS Windows has Linux/ Open Source software in part of the systems. (WSL for example)
                    Not to mention essentially 100% of major internet servers all run Linux in the cloud.
                </p>
        
        
        
              <p>So what is Linux/ FOSS, and why is it important? First lets define a few terms. F.O.S.S. and GNU. FOSS stands for Free and Open Source Software. There is also GNU or “GNU Not Unix.” Yes the acronym is part of the full name. It is a recursive acronym, another words an acronym that refers to itself. This was part of the Free Software Foundation,  The Free Software Foundation (FSF) was made in 1985 with one of its goals was to support GNU, this was made by the computer scientist Richard Stallman. He made great progress making the idea of software being free to everyone. In the 1980s Unix was the big OS so GNU was modeled after that, as a free alternative “Unix Like” OS. </p>
        
              <P>Fast forward to the early 1990s when a student at the college of Helsinki, Finland by the name of Linus Trovalds was working on a side project.  He was using a Unix variant called Minux. He created a brand new Unix based OS he called “Linux”, and what you could consider the version 1.0 was compiled in 1991. He decided to license it with the General Pubic License, and NOT copyright it. Over a small amount of time, other people who were interested in his project contributed coding and promoting it, turning it from a hobbyist project to a real world OS that was getting work done, especially in the server world. This project in the coming years and decades has enabled the creation of various companies and organizations such as Red Hat INC, Canonical, (Ubuntu) as well as various non OS programs that are under the GPL. Some of these include Libre Office, VLC,  KDEN Live video editor, The Gimp and Inkscape, and tones of other applications.</P>
        
              <p>Linus today still is one of the main contributes of Linux, though he does not work on any specific project or distribution. He and his team instead work on the core of Linux. Kernel development, device driver support,  etc. He has stated he and his family does not use MS Windows at all, just his own systems ad you would expect. </p>
                
              <p>Lastly, there is  another “Unix Like” Oses out there, but wont be the focus of this website. Mainly “BSD”. Which is the “Berkeley Software Distribution.”. This is similar to Linux, but has an even smaller user base to it. I have not used it myself and dont know as much about BSD. It is said that the Apple Mac OSX OS is based on BSD not Linux, but true BSD is very hard to find being used. Lastly I will provide URL links to distributions websites, and some YouTube channels. </p>
